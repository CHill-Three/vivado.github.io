## CHill-Three's github.io Vivado Page
Welcome to my Vivado repository created on March 14, 2021. Vivado is a Verilog-based programming platform resource designed for users to create and/or modify field-programmable gate array (FPGA) system designs. This is a list of my completed projects utilizing Vivado Design Suite. The Vivado Design Suite starter projects featured on this website are my attempts at completing starter projects with the Artix-7 FPGA Family (Package: cpg236)(Part ID: xc7a35tcpg236-1). Thank you for your time!
